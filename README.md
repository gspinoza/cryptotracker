# Cryptotracker
Cryptotracker is a prototype program that I developed when I was learning Java.\
The goal of this project was to allow users to track all their crypto transactions from different exchanges in an centralize and organized way.
Live crypto prices allows users to see how their portfolio is doing in real time.
